# Fuel

Project FUEL, founded in 2009 by Deepak Ramola, collects life lessons from people all over the world and turns them into interactive and performance activities, to pass on the learnings. The passing on happens by way of workshops, seminars, and sometimes even over coffee.

Every life is important, and so is what each person's life teaches them. At FUEL, life lessons are continuously collected, documented, thought about deeply and then turned into performance activities. This ensures that you don't just hear someone's lesson in words but experience it, tangibly, and apply it practically in your own life. The organization seeks to build a community of young adults who live, learn and share in order to make meaningful psycho-social and emotional contribution to their lives, and the society at large.

A life lesson that comes to us from another human being, can shine light on the understanding of our own life. Hence the name FUEL, which stands for Forward the Understanding of Every Life Lesson.
